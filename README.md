# MO2 SKSE Skyrim SE

Bah, acronyms.

This repo will guide you through setting up Skyrim Special Edition, Mod Organizer 2, and SKSE on
Linux, from absolutely nothing to instant-access desktop shortcuts.

**Windows users:** you don't need all this, the softwares are built natively for Windows and should
work without issue.

**MacOS users:** this guide isn't for you, but it may work. Don't blame me if things go horribly
wrong.

## I don't wanna put in any effort

I did put in the effort to write this guide. If you would like me to put in more effort, it might be
possible to [convince](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/willsterjohnson) me to write some automation
scripts.

## Okay, I'll put in the effort

That's the mindset you'll need for modding - it can take a lot of work at times, particularly if you
use mods which don't have much funding or support.

Go ahead and follow [the guide to setting up modding in Skyrim SE](./guide.md).

If you feel comfortable with Linux, the terminal, creating terminal commands, creating `.desktop`
files, working with the filesystem in bash, and generally are confident in saying you know what
you're doing when it comes to tinkering with Linux, you may prefer to use the
[Files for Nerds](./files_for_nerds/README.md). **_Be warned, I will not hold your hand, and I will
not be held accountable for any damage you do to your system._**
