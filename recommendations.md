# My Recommendations

_I've created a [text file with NXM URIs for all of my recommended mods](./nxmuri/recommendations.nxmuri)
which should be compatible with the `nxmhandler-all` script set up in the [main guide](./guide.md)._

For newer modders, or for those looking for inspiration for their next modded playthrough, here's my
list of recommended mods. These are in no particular order, and I can confidently say using these
mods with their required dependencies and patches will not cause any save-corrupting bugs provided
you don't attempt any exploits or glitches. Stay in-bounds, navigate menus as intended by the
developers, and don't use console commands.

Some items listed here are single mods, others are collections of mods which when combined achieve a
greater goal. Spoilers for some aspects of the base game, though it's been well over a decade, you
almost certainly know the plot by now.

## Necessities (Collection)

[Static Mesh Improvement Mod (SMIM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/659)
[Better Jumping](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/18967)

USSEP is required for many mods. It fixes many glitches and exploits, and favors players who play in
a lore-friendly way (i.e., not abusing game mechanics for an unintended advantage).

MCM Helper is a common dependency which allows mods to have more user-friendly settings menus.

No Spinning Death animation removes the hugely unrealistic spinning-stumble enemies do when dying.
Instead, when you bash an enemy to the ground with a battleaxe, they collapse. A much more realistic
reaction to having one's head split in two.

No BS AI Projectile Dodge stops enemies from dodging your spells and arrows in the vanilla
teleport-to-the-side way. Enemies shouldn't be able to side-step an arrow hurtling at 100m/s towards
their face.

Achievements Enabler allows you to unlock achievements while playing with mods. So long as your mods
are all lore-friendly, why shouldn't you get rewarded?

Quality World Map changes the texture of the world map to be more detailed and helpful, y'know, like
a real map would be.

YOT rephrases much of the UI text to be more immersive, shifting from typical "the game is telling
you about itself" to "the character is thinking to themself".

Yes I'm Sure removes the immersion-breaking "are you sure you want to interact with this game
mechanic?" messages, and simply assumes that when you clicked "craft", you actually knew what you
were doing.

Blended Roads makes roads look like they belong where they are by blending the meshes into the
ground texture. This removes jagged edges along roadsides, making the roads look like they're
actually built into the ground instead of being an entirely separate and unrealistic block of mess.

SMIM changes the 3D meshes of many objects in Skyrim, giving realistic texture to props and scenery.
No longer will ropes be 2D images slapped on top of a wood texture, now they exist in 3D.

Better Jumping allows you to jump while sprinting, and sets the jump height to a much more
reasonable level. Seriously, why couldn't we jump while running?

## Morrowloot Ultimate

[Nexus page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/3058)

Morrowloot Ultimate provides a loot balance overhaul, ensuring that rare items stay rare instead of
the vanilla lore-breaking progression of giving supposedly super-rare items to common bandits. It
also changes the way location levelling works, meaning if you find yourself dying repeatedly in some
old ruins, you should leave and return when you're more powerful rather than quickloading and trying
again. Some enemies _should_ be too powerful to take down with a steel axe.

## Apocalypse Magic

[Nexus Page](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/1090)

Magic in Skyrim gets boring pretty quickly. Apocalypse completely overhauls the way that magic
works, making each school just as viable, and making enemy mages far more diverse in their use of
magic, leading to interesting fights and ad-hoc mage-on-mage duels. I recommend this mod even if you
aren't playing as a mage.

## Lighting & Ambiance Immersion (Collection)

_I've created a [text file with NXM URIs for these mods](./nxmuri/lighting_ambiance_immersion.nxmuri)
which should be compatible with the `nxmhandler-all` script set up in the [main guide](./guide.md)._

[Wearable Lanterns](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/7560)
[Realistic Lighting Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/844)
[Reverb & Lighting Overhaul](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/701)

These mods will reduce the light produced by various sources to more accurately reflect reality. A
single flaming torch shouldn't illuminate an entire cavern, now, should it?

Wearable lanterns allows the Dragonborn to forge a selection of lantern types at a forge. These
lanterns can be configured to require a fuel source to run, which fits well with Survival Mode, and
can be set to turn off when sneaking, which is useful in cases where lighting effects detection.
They can also be configured to equip in a variety of locations on your character.

## Legacy of the Dragonborn (Collection)

_I've created a [text file with NXM URIs for these mods](./nxmuri/legacy_of_the_dragonborn.nxmuri)
which should be compatible with the `nxmhandler-all` script set up in the [main guide](./guide.md)._

[Legacy of the Dragonborn (LotD)](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11802)
[Legacy Safehouse Plus](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/39278)
[Official Legacy of the Dragonborn Patches](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/30980)

Legacy of the Dragonborn centers around the LotD mod, which adds a museum called the Dragonborn
Gallery in Solitude, connected to The Blue Palace on the south side of the main road. While you can
get quite far into the mod without advancing any of the major vanilla questlines, I personally
recommend becoming recognised as Dragonborn by the Greybeards before starting the museum's initial
quest. This will help cover over some dialog which is questionable in terms of immersion, for
example a line where Auryen Morellus, the museum owner, mentions that The Dragonborn Hall will be
filled with monuments heralding _your_ achievements, which could imply that Auryen believes you are
the Dragonborn.

Legacy Safehouse Plus adds some new furnishing options to the Gallery Safehouse, a residence you may
use after procuring enough items for the museum displays. These can both improve the immersion, and
be useful to you in various ways.

The official patches improve compatibility with a variety of mods. Be sure to reinstall this mod
after installing a new mod which has available patches.

## Vigilant (Collection)

_I've created a [text file with NXM URIs for these mods](./nxmuri/vigilant.nxmuri) which should be
compatible with the `nxmhandler-all` script set up in the [main guide](./guide.md)._

[Vigilant](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11849)
[Vigilant English Voice](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/11894)

Vigilant is a questline started by meeting a Vigilant of Stendarr in Dawnstar. It starts off slowly,
introducing you to the day-to-day work of the Vigilants while setting up the starting point of the
plot. You'll face off against some powerful opponents as you progress, unravelling the history of
several daedric mysteries as you witness their futures unfold before you.

Vigilant English Voice adds voice acting in English to the mod, though other languages may be
available if you prefer.

This mod may still be enjoyed by players who's character is not aligned with the Vigilants goals.
For example in my first playthrough with this mod, my character's primary goal was to do anything in
the name of becoming more powerful. Upon hearing that the Vigilants were facing off against powerful
daedra, my character decided to join to both test their power, and to claim for themself the power
that can be found in daedric artifacts.
