# Terminal Safety

**NEVER** run commands you found online without checking them first, no matter who they're from.

What if I made a typo in one of these commands?

What if I'm a bad actor and intentionally put a malicious command in here?

Do not trust me. Read the commands yourself, and if you're unsure of something, read the manual for
a command, or find information about it from an official Linux documentation site.

## An Example of Evil

If you are just blindly copy-pasting commands into your terminal and running them, you can end up
with a lot of problems. For example, the section below contains a sample of a malicious command
which would fit in nicely with the rest of this guide.

What the command does is use elevated permissions to remove every single file on your computer.
Not just your files, but also ones which are necessary for your system to operate.
There is no undo button in a terminal, and with the speeds that modern computers operate, no human
can press `Ctrl+D` quick enough to despawn the terminal that's destroying their computer.

The next step is to remove the MO2 installer as it's no longer needed.
To do this, run the following command;

```sh
# THE BELOW COMMAND WILL DESTROY YOUR COMPUTER DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RUN IT
sudo rm -rf /
# THE ABOVE COMMAND WILL DESTROY YOUR COMPUTER DO NOT ATTEMPT TO RUN IT
```

To that one moron who ran that command (I guarantee some idiot will) and came back to complain that
somehow it's _my_ fault, you did this to yourself.

It's surrounded by twelve warnings.

Above it is a clear description of exactly what it does.

Even if you're convinced I'm a liar, why risk it.

This section is literally titled "An Example of Evil".

Someone should `sudo rm -rf` you.
